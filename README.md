# FXCoreMP Tools
This project contains code and support files for 3 major tooling enhancements for the  [FXCore DSP Assembler](https://www.experimentalnoize.com/product_FXCore.php).
These tools were developed to support the firmware used in our [CT3680|https://cabintechglobal.com/ct3680] multichannel delay module.

The major features this project adds to FXCore assembly development include:
* A macro-substitution language for FXCore assembler similar to
how the C/C++ preprocessor adds macro capabilities to C and C++ language files.
* An alternative assembler language syntax called "TOON" (Target Of Operations Notation) that improves the readability and aids understanding the logic and sequence of
FXCore programs.
* Support for using the Eclipse IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for FXCore assembler development.

Each of these features can be used independently or together.

See the [main documentation pages](../../wiki) for an overview of the project, installation instructions, and reference material.
