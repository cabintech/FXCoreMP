# FXCoreMP Macro Processor
This processor implements a macro-substitution language for the [FXCore DSP Assembler](https://www.experimentalnoize.com/product_FXCore.php) similar to
how the C/C++ preprocessor adds macro capabilities to C and C++ language files. In addition to a macro language, this project
implements an alternative assembler language called "TOON" (Target Of Operations Notation) that improves the readability and aids understanding the logic and sequence of
FXCore programs. These two functions (macro processor and TOON syntax) may be used together or independantly.

See the documentation for a overview of this project, the macro language, installation instructions, example macros, and the TOON alternative assembler syntax.
